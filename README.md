# The Selective Camera

## Brief Introduction
This program automatically determines whether or not a face is considered to be
"attractive" or not. Using a Neural Network, the face information is parsed as
black-and-white and then given to the parameters which determines whether or
not the score passes the threshold or not.

## Inspiration
I was reading Doraemon (it's a Japanese magna), and there is one gadget called
"The Selective Camera" which only takes pictures of people the camera likes.
While this program will never develop a full sense of awareness like the camera,
it does its best to mimic the thought process of a human brain through neurons
represented by the Neural Network.

## Notes
I could not include actual training data (faces) here due to privacy reasons.

## Special Thanks
Andrew Ng, for his awesome Coursera Machine Learning course which the concepts
taught led to the creation of this project.
Fujiko F. Fujio, for his creativity, writing Doraemon magna which inspired
this project.
